# Cantor's Labyrinth (SeriousGame)

Playable in-browser at https://crompo.itch.io/cantors-labyrinth
(Recommended - ensure "Use graphics acceleration when available" is enabled in browser settings)

My final year project in University, a "Serious Game" designed to teach set theory principles through gameplay.

This is a Unity project. For the C# code, see Assets/Scripts.

All sprites and programming were done by me, sounds were CC0 from freesound.org.
